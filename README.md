## Sections Course Format

This is a Moodle course format based on the "Sections" format, but adding some extra features.

The Moodle 4.4 branch is a rewrite of the old code - based on the core Sections format but adding in the following features:
  * Hide section 0 when viewing another section
  * Add a news forum/social forum display under section 0 when viewing the course "home"
  * Allow the user to swap between showing one section per page and all sections on the same page.
